          Moral Ethics

          <strong>Abstract: </strong>
          Due to the complexities of critical care nursing, ethical
          considerations have become an integral part of care. As a direct
          result of conﬂicts within care, nurses are now more exposed to ethical
          dilemmas. Conﬂicts can arise from situations involving withholding
          treatment, deciding when the burdens of further therapeutic measures
          outweigh the beneﬁts, limited resources, and deciding entry criteria
          to critical care units. Ethical issues can also arise from the usage
          of complicated technology, the vulnerability of patients and the
          complex decision-making processes.
